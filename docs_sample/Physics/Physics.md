## Physical Quantities and Units

The role of science is to develop a better
understanding of the physical world around
us and make the physical world better.

Physics is an experimental science which
involves the observing and measuring of a
various phenomenon of nature. It is
important that measurements be accurately
taken and recorded. These measurements
are then used o make connections between
the measured phenomena is called a
theory.

The theory must then be tested
experimentally so that it may either be
verified or distorted.

A physical quantity refers to a quantitative
description of the physical phenomena. A
physical quantity may be defined by

```
a) A procedure for measuring (eg.
distance and time)
b) A procedure for calculating (eg. 
speed = $\frac{distance}{time}$
```



Most physical quantities consist of a
product of a numerical magnitude and a
unit.

## Base Quantities and Base Units

```
There are seven base quantities and seven
corresponding base units outlined by
systemé International (S.I).
```
```
Base Quantity Base Unit
Mass, m Kilogram (kg)
Length, l Metre (m)
Time, t Second (s)
Temperature, T Kelvin (K)
Electric current, I Ampere (A)
Amount of substance, n
Mole (mol)
Luminous intensity,Iv
Candele (cd)
```
## The Mole

```
Is the amount of substance which contains
as many elementary units (atoms/
ions/molecules) as there are atoms in
0.012kg of carbon – 12.
The number of elementary units per mole is
called the Avogadro constant , NA. it is the
same for all the substances.
```
```
$$NA = 6.02 × 10^{23} mol
^{-1}$$
```

## Derived Quantity and Derived Units

```
All other quantities are called derived
quantities. There are obtained in
accordance with a defined equation for the
quantity which may involve

```
a) One or more base quantities
b) Base quantities and derived
quantities
c) Derived quantities
```
The corresponding derived units are
obtained by the same mathematical
operation used to obtain the derived
quantity.

Same derived quantity have no units and
are called dimensionless quantities (eg.
refractive index and relative density)

| Derived Quantity   | Derived Unit               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Area (A) - Rectangle | \(A = L \times B\) (rectangle) |
|                    | \(m \times m = m^2\)          |
| Volume (V) - Cuboid | \(V = L \times B \times H\) (cuboid) |
|                    | \(m \times m \times m = m^3\)  |
| Density (\(𝜌\))      | \(𝜌 = \frac{)}{+} \cdot ! = \text{kg m}^{-3}\) |
| Speed (\(v\))       | \(v = \#) (\# = \text{ms}^{-1}\) |
| Acceleration (\(a\)) | \(a = *-. \$) (\$ = \text{ms}^{-2}\) |
| Force (F)           | \(F = ma\) (\(Kg \times \text{ms}^{-2} = \text{kgms}^{-2} = \text{Newton (N)}\)) |
| Pressure (P)        | \(P = \frac{/}{0 1}) (\text{Nm}^{-2} \text{ or Pascal (Pa)}) |
| Work (W)            | \(W = F \times g\) (\(N \times \text{m} = \text{Nm or Joule (J)}\)) |
| Power (P)           | \(P = \frac{2}{3 4}) (\text{Js}^{-1} \text{ or Watt (W)}) |

## Dimensional Analysis

```
a) Dimensional analysis may be used to
check the homogeneity of physical
equations.
```
Example: Ek =^56 mv^2

```
L.H.S [J] = [Nm]
= [kg \cdot m^2/s^2] \quad \text{(Joules)}
= [kg \cdot m/s^2] \cdot [m] \quad \text{(Joules)}
= \text{R.H.S}
Therefore, the equation is homogeneous
```
```
\[R.H.S [kg][m/s^{-1}]^2 \\= [kg][m^2 s^2] \\= [kgm^2 s^{-2}]\]\\L.H.S = R.H.S



R.H.S [kg][ms-^1 ]^2 = [kg][m^2 s^2 ]

b) Dimensional analysis may be used in
deriving certain equations.
```
```
Example: In a particular experiment
it was found that the period, T of a
single pendulum depended on its
length, l the acceleration due to
gravity, g and the mass of the bob,

used to help in working out solution
problems.
```
```

garden hose at a rate of 15kg per min
and exists the nozzle at 20 ms-^1.

```
## Scalars and Vectors

```
Scalar quantities are those which are
specified by their magnitude only.
Example: Mass and Speed.
Vector quantities are those which are
specified by both magnitude and direction.
Example: Displacement, Velocity,
Momentum, Force, Impulse.
```
## Addition of Scalars and Vectors

```
Scalars are added by simply finding their
arithmetic sum.
When adding vectors both magnitude and
direction must be considered.
```
```
Example:
Parallel Vectors

```

**Antiparallel Vectors**

Resultant, F R = 16 + (-12)

= 4N

The resultant of vectors can also be found
using:

```
a) Parallelogram of Vectors
Vectors A and B are drawn from the
same origin. A straight line is drawn
parallel to A and another parallel to
B to form a parallelogram. The
resultant A and B is represented by
the diagonal which passes through
the origin.
```
```
b) Triangle of Vectors
Vectors A and B are drawn so that
the head of A touches the tail of B.
```
```
the triangle is completed by drawing
the tail of A to the head of B. this
represents the resultant of A + B.

## Resolving Vectors

```
A vector, F can be considered to be the
resultant of 2 vectors. These vectors are
called components or resolves parts of the
vector, F. there is an infinite number of
pairs or vectors which can give the
resultant, F. however, it is often most
convenient to resolve the vectors into
mutually perpendicular components.

## Errors

There are two types of errors which may
occur in the measurement of the physical
quantity.

```
Ø Random Error
Ø Systematic Error
```
**Random Error**

**When repeated measurements** of the
same quantity **give rise to different values**.
A random error is said to have occurred.

These result in a scatter of readings about a
mean value and have an equal chance of
being positive or negative.

**Random errors may be caused by**

```
a) Inability of the observer to repeat a
procedure exactly.
Example 1: Variation in reaction
time in starting and stopping a
stopwatch.
```
```
Example 2: Interpretation of the
actually position of the pointer on
the scale.
```
```
b) Sensitivity of the measuring
instrument
Example 1: The mechanics of the
moving coil meter may cause the
pointer to settle in different
```
```
positions even though the same
value is being measured.
```
```
c) A particular measurement not
being reproducible.
Example 1: When measuring how
temperature falls with time for a
particular substance, a value missed
cannot be retrieved even though the
experiment is repeated.
```
```
Random errors may be revealed by
repeating observations of a particular
quantity. If an average is then calculated for
a measurement, then the random error
may be reduced.
```
```
Systematic Error
A systematic error changes all
measurements of a particular quantity
equally.
Systematic errors result in all the readings
taken being faulty in one direction.
Systematic errors may be caused by
a) An instrument having a zero error
Example: A disconnected ammeter
which reads 0.2 A will result in all
measurements being 0.2 A too large.
```
```
Example 2: A micrometer screw
gauge which is not at zero when it is
fully closed.
```
```
Incorrect calibration of an instrument.
```

Example: A liquid in glass thermometer
which does not have 100 equal divisions
between 0 and 100.

The **observer** persistently **carrying out the
wrong reaction.**

Example:

Systematic errors may be eliminated or
corrected by:

```
a) Varying all conditions of the
experiment
Example: Using a different meter
```
```
b) Suitable mathematical treatment of
the observation
Example: Adding\subtracting the
zero error.
```
## Precision and Accuracy

An **accurate experiment** is one in which the
**systematic error is relatively small.**

A **precise experiment** is one in which the
**random error is relatively small**.

```
Measure value is close to the actual value
à small s accurate.
```
```
Large scatter of values à large random
error and hence is not precise.
```
```
Measured value is far from actual value à
large systematic error and hence the
experiment is not accurate
```
```
Small scatter of values à small random
error and hence it is precise.
systematic error and hence the experiment
```
## Uncertainties

```
Suppose a reading, x is obtained of a quality
whose true value is x, then
x = x ± e
e is called the absolute uncertainty in the
measurement.
```
```
Fractional uncertainty, P = 𝒙𝒆 Usually f << 1
```
```
Percentage uncertainty, P = 𝒆𝒙 × 100.
Usually P << 100.

## Types of Forces

```
a) Contact Forces are produced by the
physical interaction between bodies.
i. Applied Forces- pushing/ pulling
force exerted by one object or
another.
ii. Frictional Forces - the force which
tends to oppose the relative motion
between objects or surfaces.
iii. Tension Force- force acting in a
string or a wire or a spring which is
held tout.
iv. Normal Force- is a force exerted on
a object which is resting on a surface
or a fixed support are normal to the
surface.
```
```
b) Non- Contact Forces are produced
by the interaction of fields or fields
of force.
i. Electric Forces- are produced by the
interaction of two or more electric
fields. Example: Between two points
charges.
*Maybe one of attraction or
repulsion.
ii. Magnetic Forces- which is produced
by the interaction of the 2 or more
magnetic fields. Example: Between 2
permanent magnetics, Between 2
permanent magnets and one
current carrying conductor, Between
2 current carrying conductors.
*Forces maybe of attraction and
repulsion.
iii. Nuclear Force- very strong forces of
attraction which holds the particles
of the nucleus together.
```
```
iv. Gravitational Forces- are produced
by the interaction of gravitational
fields around masses and are very
weak unless at least one of the
objects has a very large mass.
Example: The earth
The gravitational force exerted by
the earth an object is called the
weight of the object.
W = mg
m = mass of object (kg)
g – gravitational strength (Nkg-^1 )
```
```
Nkg-^1 = kg ms-^2 , kg-^1
= ms-^2
Therefore, gravitational field
strength is sometimes called the
acceleration due to gravity
```
## Up thrust on a Body in Fluid

```
Consider a cylinder of height, l and cross-
sectional area, A totally submerged in a
fluid on density, 𝜌. such that its upper
surface as at a depth, h from the surface of
a fluid and its lower surface is at a depth, h 2
from the surface of the fluid.
```

At the depth, h the pressure p is given by
𝜌gh

F = P× A à F = 𝜌gh A

At a particular depth the pressure on the
sides the cylinder are the same and
therefore the result horizontal force is zero.

The pressure difference of P 2 – P 1 produces
a resultant upward force or up thrust on the
cylinder.

Up thrust, u = F 2 – F 1

F = 𝜌gh A à U = 𝜌gh 2 A – 𝜌gh, A

=𝜌gA (h 1 – h 2 )

But h 2 – h 1 = height of cylinder, e

à u = 𝜌gAl

But Al = volume of cylinder

= volume of fluid displaced, V

à u = 𝜌gv à v = A (h 1 – h 2 ) = Al

But 𝜌v = mass of fluid displaced, m 𝜌 = )*

à u = mg

But mg = weight of fluid displaced, W

i.e. u = W

i.e. Up trust = weight of fluid displaced.

## Archimedes Principle

```
A body which is partly or totally
submerged in a fluid experiences am up
thrust which is equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced.
```
## Principle of Flotation

```
A floating body displaces its own weight on
the fluid which it floats.
For a floating body:
Up thrust = Weight of body
```
```
i.e. Weight of fluid = weight of body
displaced
```
## Frictional Forces

```
The force that opposes or tends to oppose
the relative motion between 2 bodies is
called the force of friction.
Frictional forces are presents in the relative
motion between 2 solids, in liquids, in gases
and solid object moving through liquids and
gases.
```
```
Whenever there is relative motion between
bodies work is done against friction and the
work done is converted into thermal
energy.
```
## Frictional Forces in Solids

```
Consider an object of weight, W resting on
a rough horizontal surface, A gradually
```

increasing force it applies to the object
parallel to the surface.

p = applied force

w = weight

R = normal reaction

F = frictional force

**Initially** as P is increased, the object does
not move and is therefore in equilibrium
which implies that

## F = P

If the object remains in **equilibrium as P
increases, then the frictional force also
increases.**

At a particular value for P the object just
starts to move at this point the **frictional
forces is a maximum and is called the
limiting frictional force.** The object is said
to be **in limiting equilibrium.**

The frictional fore which acts while **the
object is still stationary is called static
friction.**

```
When the object is in limiting equilibrium ,
the friction force is directly proportional to
the normal reaction.
F ∝ R
F = R m – coefficient of friction
In general F ≤ mR
```
```
When there is relative motion between the
surfaces , the frictional force is called sliding
or dynamic or kinetic friction.
(The nature of the frictional force is at the
points contact). The nature of the frictional
force results from the forces of attraction
between the points of contacts between
the 2 surfaces while they rest on each
other.
```
## Laws of Friction

```
1 st – The friction force between two
surfaces opposes the relative motion or
attempted motion between the surfaces.
```
```
2 nd – The frictional force is dependent of
the area of contact between the surfaces.
```
```
3 rd – The limiting frictional force is directly
proportional to the normal reaction F∝ R, F
= mR
```
## Viscous Forces

```
Viscous/drag force is the frictional force in
fluids. i.e. in liquids and gases.
```
```
P
```
```
R
```
```
F
W
```

In liquids, the viscous force arises from the
intermolecular forces of attraction between
adjacent layers of liquid. Example: A liquid
which flows through a channel is considered
to flow in layers. The layer or contact with
the channel is at rest. This layer exerts
intermolecular forces of attraction on the
layer adjacent to it and so on. The result is
that the layer at the center of the channel
flows with the greatest speed.

In gases, the viscous force arises as a result
of the interchange of molecules between
adjacent layers of flow of gas.

When an object moves through a fluid, **the
viscous drag force exerted on the object
depends on:**

```
i. The shape of the object
ii. The viscosity of the object
iii. The velocity of the object.
```
**F** ∝ **V - laminar conditions**

**F** ∝ **V**^2 **– turbulent conditions**

## Static Equilibrium

**Moments of a force or torque**

Definition: **The moment of a force about an
axis is the product of the force and the**

```
perpendicular distance of its lines action
from the axis.
```
```
Moment of force about axis =
Force × Perpendicular distance of
force from axis
T = F × r
```
```
Notes:
Ø Units: Nm
Ø A couple consists of two forces
which are equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction and which do
not act along the same line so that
they produce rotation.
```
```
Torque of couple = (F × AB) + (F × BC)
= F (AB + BC)
= F × AC
= F × perpendicular
distance between
the forces.

## Principle of Moments

For rigid body in equilibrium, the algebraic
sum of the moments of the forces about
any axis is zero.

## Conditions for Equilibrium

1. The resultant force is any two
    mutually perpendicular directions is
    zero.
2. The resultant torque about any axis
    is zero

## Triangle of Forces

If 2 forces acting on a point can be
represented in magnitude and direction b
the sides of a triangle take in order, then
the 3 forces would produce a resultant of
zero.

Note:

1. The converse of this is true
2. The rule can be extended to a
    polygon of forces.

```
*The resultant of F, and F 2 is equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction to F 3
and therefore the resultant is zero.

If the velocity of an object is
uniform, then the velocity change is
zero and hence the acceleration is
zero.
If velocity increases, then the object
is said to be accelerating and if the
velocity decreases then the object is
said to be decelerating.
An object is said to be moving with
uniform acceleration if the velocity
change is constant per unit time.
```
```
a = *-$.

```
v = final velocity
u = initial velocity

## Displacement- Time (s.t) Graph

The s.t graph shows how the displacement
of an object from a particular position (the
origin) varies with time.

**The gradient of the s.t graph gives the
velocity of the object.**

If the velocity is constantly changing, then
the gradient of the tangent at a point gives
the velocity of the object at that point (i.e.
instantaneous velocity).

If the velocity is constant over a given time
interval, then the gradient is constant, and
the velocity maybe calculated by finding the
gradient over the time interval.

Positive or negative gradient indicates
positive or negative velocity which indicates
the **direction** of motion of the object.

```
Positive or negative displacements indicates
the position of the object relative to the
origin.
When v and s have the same sign, they
move away from the origin.
When v and s have different signs, they
move towards the origin.
```
```
From A velocity increased gently to B
From B velocity increased uniformly to C
From C the decrease velocity occurs to D
From D to E the velocity is zero, the
distance is S 1
From E to F velocity is negative and slowly
increases.
From F to G the velocity is negative,
uniformly increases.
From G to H, the displacement is negative,
velocity is negative, and uniformly
increasing.
```

From H to I, the displacement is negative,
velocity is negative and decreases gently.

From I to J, the displacement is negative,
velocity positive and slowly/gently
increasing.

From J to K, the displacement is negative,
velocity decreasing becomes zero.

## Velocity – Time Graphs

```
The velocity time graphs show how the
velocity of an object varies with time.
The gradient of the velocity time graph
gives the acceleration of the object;
a) If the acceleration of the object is
constantly changing, then the
acceleration at a point (i.e.
instantaneous acceleration) is the
gradient at the tangent of the point.
b) If the acceleration of the object is
uniform over a given time interval,
then the gradient is constant and
acceleration is determined by
calculating the gradient over the
time interval.
```
```
The area under the velocity time
graph in a given time interval gives
```

```
the distance travelled by the object
in that time.
```
```
The negative and positive signs for
velocity indicate the direction in
which the object is travelling.
The negative and positive signs for
acceleration indicates the direction
in which the object is changing.
```

When both a and v are in the same

direction, v decreases

## Projectiles

```
Consider the motion of particle when
projected in a uniform gravitational field in
any direction. The following terms describe
the projectile motion:
```
1. **The Trajectory-** is the path
    described by the particle.
2. **The range-** is the distance between
    the point of projection and the point
    where the trajectory meets any
    plane through the point of the
    projection.
3. **The angle of projection-** is the angle
    between the direction of projection
    and the horizontal plane through
    the point of projection.

```
Consider a particle projected in a uniform
gravitational field without air resistance.
The particle is projected with a velocity, u at
an angle Ɵ to the horizontal. At time, t the
particle has a velocity, v and is at the angle
∝ to the horizontal. The vertical and
horizontal displacements at this time are x
and y respectively.
```

In projectile motion, the vertical and
horizontal motion are considered
separately since the acceleration due to
gravity acts vertically. The initial velocity, u
is therefore resolved into its vertical and
horizontal components.

The horizontal components of velocity
remain constant throughout motion.
However, the vertical component of
velocity is affected by g and therefore
changes with time. The equations of
motions can therefore be used when
considered the vertical motion of the
projectile.

Notes:

1. **Horizontal velocity** therefore
    remains constant Vh = ucosƟ
2. **Vertical velocity** therefore v = u + at
    à v = sinƟ – gt
    V^2 = u^2 + 2as
    V^2 = u^2 sin^2 Ɵ – 2 gy

    = C𝑢^6 𝑐𝑜𝑠^6 Ɵ+ 𝑢^6 𝑠𝑖𝑛^6 Ɵ− 2 𝑔𝑦
    = C𝑢^6 (𝑐𝑜𝑠^6 Ɵ+𝑠𝑖𝑛^6 Ɵ)− 2 𝑔𝑦

    Vertical motion: y = u sin Ɵ. t - 56 gt^2

## Terminal Velocity

```
Motion in a uniform gravitational field
with air resistance
Consider an object released from rest
from a very high point in a uniform
gravitational field where the air
resistance in not neglible.
```
```
U = up thrust
W = weight
F = drag force
F ∝ V = luminar condition
F ∝ V^2 turbulent conditions
Resultant Force, FR = W -U – F
Initial – the object is at rest i.e v = 0 à F = 0
à FR = W – U
```
```
As the velocity, v increases, the drag force,
f increases, and this causes the resultant
force, FR to decrease. The acceleration of
the object therefore decreases (.F = ma),
the velocity of the object still increases but
now at a lower rate. As the velocity
increases further, the drag force, F also
```
```
g v
```
```
U F
```
```
W
```

**increases, and the FR decreases further.**
This continues until the resultant force; **F =
0** and hence the **acceleration = 0**. The
object then falls with a constant velocity
called the **terminal velocity**.

Terminal Velocity= 0 à W – U – F = 0

à W = U + F

Question: Consider an object thrown
vertically upwards with a velocity, v in a
uniform gravitational field. The object
reaches its maximum height and on return
attains terminal velocity. Draw and explain
the velocity time graph for the motion of
the object.

Shaded regions must be equal because
velocity going up is equal to velocity going
down.

#### A 1 = A 2

```
Distance up = Distance Down
T 1 < T 2
Starter time up then come down
Downward motion
FR = W – F – U
```
## Upward Motion

```
Initially velocity is maximum and hence the
drag force, F is a maximum. The resultant
force, FR is maximum.
```
```
This force opposes the motion and
therefore the velocity decreases.
```
```
As the object moves upwards the velocity
decreases and the drag force, F decreases
and hence the magnitude of FR decreases
(which implies that acceleration decreases)
```
## At Maximum Height

```
Velocity = 0
Drag force, F = 0
```
## Downward Motion

```
As the velocity of the object increases from
0, the drag force, F also increases and the
resultant force, FR decreases. This continues
until the object reaches terminal velocity.
```

## Dynamics

## Newton’s Laws of Motion

**Newton’s First Law**

A body continues in its state of rest or of
uniform motion in a straight line (i.e.
uniform velocity unless acted upon by a
resultant force).

Note:

This law suggests that a body which is at
rest requires a resultant force for motion
and if a body is moving a resultant force is
required to increase/ decrease the
magnitude of the velocity or change the
direction of the velocity.

The **inertia** of a body is the resistance to
change in motion and therefore Newton’s
First Law is sometimes called the law of
inertia.

A body of large mass requires a large force
to change its motion and therefore **the
mass of a body is a measure of its inertia**.

```
Mass Weight
Is the measure of
the inertia of a
body.
```
```
Is the force which
gravity exerts on a
body.
Unit: kg Unit: N

```

```
Newton’s Second Law
The rate of change of momentum of a body
is directly proportional to the resultant
force acting on the body and takes place in
the direction of the force
```
```
Notes:
```
```
F ∝ ∆(∆)*I)
```
```
If the velocity is constant: F ∝ V ∆∆)$
```
```
If the velocity mass is constant: F ∝ m ∆∆*$
```
```
Or if velocity changes uniformly
∆v = v – u
```
```
F ∝ )^ (*$-.)
```
```
Acceleration, a = ∆∆.$ or *-$.
```
```
F ∝ ma
F = kma; k is constant of proportionality
```
```
By Definition
The newton is the force which produces a
acceleration of 1ms-^1 when it acts on a mass
of 1kg
1N = 1kgms-^2
à K = 1
```

F = ma

Resultant force and acceleration are always
in the same direction.

Definition

The resultant force exerted on a body is
defined as its rate of change of momentum.

**Newton’s Third Law**

When object A exerts a force on B, object B
exerts an equal and opposite force of an
object A.

Notes:

The forces are equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction and they act on
different bodies.

Examples:

**Satellite Orbit**

F 1 - gravitational force of attraction which
the earth exerts on the moon.

## Linear Momentum, 𝞺

Definition,

**The linear momentum of a body is defined
as the product of its mass and velocity.**

𝞺 = mv

Notes:

Units: kgms-^1 or Ns

Vector quantity whose direction is the same
0 as that of velocity of the body.

## Principle of Conservation of Linear

## Momentum

Consider an object A of mass, m and initial
velocity, u colliding with an object B of
mass, m 2 and initial velocity, u 2. The objects
collide for a short time interval, t and after
collision, A and B move off with velocities V,
and V 2 respectively.

Newton’s Third Law FA = - FB

Newton’s Second Law =

)#(*#$-^ .#) = -)$^ (*$$-^ .$)

M 1 V 1 – M 1 U 1 = -M 2 V 2 + M 2 U 2

M 1 U 2 + M 2 U 2 = M 1 V 1 + M 2 V 2

total initial = total final

momentum momentum

```
The principle of conservation of linear
momentum states that if no external
forces act on a system then the total linear
momentum is a given direction remains
constant.
```
## Classification of Collisions

```
Inelastic Collisions – Are those in which
kinetic energy is not conserved. The kinetic
energy is usually is usually converted to
heat or sound.
A completely inelastic collision is one in
which the base stick together after impact.
The loss of kinetic energy is large but not
complete.
```
```
Elastic Collisions – are those in which
kinetic energy is conserved example: gas
molecules make elastic collisions with each
other.
Consider a perfectly elastic head on
collision between 2 bodies A and B whose
masses are m 1 and m 2 respectively and
initial velocities u 1 and u 2 respectively. After
collisions A and B move with velocities v 1
and v 2 respectively.
```
```
By the Principles of Conservation of Linear
Momentum: M 1 U 1 + M 2 U 2 = M 1 V 1 + M 2 V 2

From equation 1:

M 1 U 1 – M 1 V 1 = M 2 V 2 + M 2 U 2

M 1 (U 1 – V 2 ) = M 2 (V 2 – U 2 )......3

From equation 2:

M 1 U 12 - M 1 V 12 = M 2 V 22 - M 2 U 22

## Impulse

Definition

**The impulse of a force is the product of a
force and the time for which it acts**

**Impulse = Ft**

Note:

According to Newton’s Second Law

F = )*-$). à Ft = mv – mu

à Impulse = Change in momentum

Units: kgms-^1 or Ns

```
The term impulse is usually associated with
a force which acts for a short time.
However, it can be applied to smaller forces
which act over a longer period.
```
```
When an object undergoes a momentum
change by an applied force. The applied
force maybe large for a short time interval
and still produces the same momentum
change.
```
```
Example:
```
1. Jumping with knees bent reduce
    force
2. Air- bag increases the time interval
    for impact therefore decreasing the
    force.

```
Force on a Rocket
```
```
Consider a very small-time intervals ∆t, such
that the force can be considered constant.
```
```
Impulse = F ∆ t
```

Momentum change, ∆p = F ∆ t

**Head on Collisions**

Notes:

At any instant during collision, the forces on
the cars are equal on magnitude and
opposite in direction. This means that the
graphs for the cars will have the same
shape and size.

The areas for car A and car B are equal in
magnitude but opposite in sign which
means the impulse for both cars are equal
in magnitude but opposite direction i.e. the
momentum change for the cars are equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction and
hence the total momentum change for
collision is zero i.e. momentum is
conserved.

Consider a body moving with a constant
velocity, u and a force is applied for a short
time, ∆t producing a momentum change ∆p
with the final velocity of the car being V.
Sketch the momentum time graph for the
following:

## Circular Motion

```
Consider a particle of mass, m moving along
an arc AB of a circle with center, O and
radius, r with a constant speed, v in a time
interval, t
```

## Angular Displacements, Ɵ

The angular displacements are the angle
subtended to the center of the circle by an
arc of the circle.

Angular displacements = 0:':%!".#^ ;(&,d$

Ɵ = :#

Notes:

**Angular displacement** is the radian (rad)

**Period, T** is the time taken for one complete
revolution.

**Frequency, F** is the number of revolutions
per second

Notes:

S.I Units of frequency is the Hertz (Hz)

1 Hz = 1 revolution per second

By definition f =^53

**Angular Velocity, W (omega)**

```
The angular velocity is defined as the
change of angular displacement per unit
time
```
```
W = !!$Ɵ or ∆∆D$
```
```
Notes:
S.I units rads-^1
If the particle moves with a constant speed
as above then:
```
```
W = Ɵ$
```
```
If the particle moves through an angular
displacement of 2𝜋 rads in the periodic
time, T.

```
## Centripetal acceleration and

## Antripetal force

```
As the particle moves from A to B, the
speed is constant, however the velocity
changes since the direction of the motion
changes and velocity is a vector quantity. If
```

the velocity changes then by definition the
particle is accelerating.by Newton’s 2nd law
(F = ma) there must also be a resultant
force which is in the direction of the
acceleration.

The magnitude of the velocity is unchanged,
and the acceleration and force must be
perpendicular to the travel at any instant.
The accelerated is directed towards the
center of the circular path and is called the
centripetal acceleration. The resultant force
is in the same direction and is called the
centripetal force.

Notes:
A centripetal force is not a force in the
system, but it is the fore which is required
to keep an object moving in a circular path.
The centripetal force is provided by the
resultant of forces acting towards the
center of the circular path.
Examples:
**Conical Pendulum**
If the object is moving in a horizontal circle,
then there is no vertical motion
Resultant vertical force = 0
i.e. T cos Ɵ = mg
the horizontal component of T acts towards
0 and provides the centripetal force which
is required to keep the object moving in a
circular path

**Orbiting Satellite**


The gravitational force of attraction which

centripetal force which is required to keep

earth.

**Vehicle Moving Around a Bend**

keep a vehicle moving with a speed, v in an

area of radius, r is given by )*

$

centripetal force is provided by the
frictional force, f which acts towards the
center of the circular path. The frictional
force however has a maximum value (ƞ𝑅). If

```
the centripetal force needed exceeds the
maximum frictional force then the vehicle
slides and follows an arc of a larger radius
thus reducing the centripetal force which is
required.
```
```
Banked Tracks
```
```
Consider a vehicle of mass, m moving
around a banked track inclined at an angle,
Ɵ in a circular track of a horizontal radius, r
and center, O.
If there is no vertical motion, then
Resultant vertical force = 0
à R 1 cos Ɵ + R 2 cos Ɵ = mg
(R 1 + R 2 ) cos Ɵ = mg......1
If there is no slipping along the slope, then
the components of R 1 and R 2 acting towards
O provide the centripetal force.

When the speed is increased, the normal
reactant is decreased to obtain a greater
centripetal force. At a critical speed the
normal reactants zero and all the weight is
used as a force hence you experience a
feeling of weightlessness.

## Gravitation

## Gravitational Field

A gravitational field is said to exist at a point
if a gravitational force is exerted on a mass
placed at the point.

Notes:

```
Ø Gravitational forces are always
forces of attraction
Ø Gravitational forces are mostly
negliable unless atleast one very
massive body is involved. Example:
the earth
Ø The direction of the gravitational
field at a point is the direction of the
force exerted on a mass at that
point.
```
## Gravitational Field Strength, g

```
The gravitational field strength at a point in
gravitational field is the force exerted per
unit mass at that point.
```
```
g = i/
```
```
Notes:
Ø Units: Nkg- 1
Ø g is a vector quantity whose
direction is the same as that of the
force exerted.
Ø From Newton’s second law (a = )/)
and therefore the gravitational force
exerted at a mass at a point in the
gravitational field produces an
acceleration which is numerically
equal to the gravitational field
strength and hence g is sometimes
called the acceleration due to
gravity. Furthermore, the units are
the same for gravitational field
strength and acceleration.

## Geostationary Orbits


A satellite above the equator moving in the
earth’s direction of rotation with an orbital
period of 24hrs will always be at the same
point above the earth’s surface. This
satellite is called a geostationary satellite
and is said to be in a geostationary orbit

These satellites are used to relate
telephone signals from one point on the
earth to the other.

When a satellite is to be placed in a
geostationary orbit; it is first carried to the
required height and once it is given the
necessary tangential velocity by firing
rocket engines that are parallel to the
rocket surface.

Questions: A satellite of mass 200kg is to be
placed in a geostationary orbit. Given that
the mass of the earth is 6.0 × 104 kg and its
radius is 6.4 × 106 m. Calculate:

1. Height above the earth’s surface to
    which the satellite is to be taken
2. The required tangential velocity at
    this height

## Work, Energy and Power

```
Work, W
```

Work done by the force whose points of
application moves through a displacement
in the direction of the force is the product
of the force and displacement.

W = Fs

Notes:

```
Ø The S.I unit of work is The Joule (J)
Ø The joule is the work done when the
force of 1W moves its point of
application through a distance of 1m
in the direction of the force.
1 J = 1Nm
Ø Consider a force, F applied to an
object causing the object to move
through a displacement, s at an
angle Ɵ to the direction of the force.
```
F sin Ɵ is perpendicular to s and therefore
does not work.

Work done, W = F cos Ɵ × s

W = F. s cos Ɵ

Consider a variable force, f producing a
displacement, s.

```
Consider a very small displacement ∆𝑠 such
that the force, f can be considered a
constant.
By definition: Work done, ∆𝑊 = F∆𝑠
= Area of shaded strip
Total work done = Area under the F – s
graph

## Principle of Conservation of Energy

The total energy in a closed system is to be
conserved.

## Kinetic Energy, Ek

Is the energy that the body posses by virtue
of its motion.

Consider a body of mass, m accelerated
uniformly with acceleration, a from a
velocity u to a velocity, v in a time, t as it
moves through a displacement, s.

Change in K.E, ∆ EK = Work done = W

```
W = Fs ∆ EK = Fs
F = ma à ∆ EK = mas
```
```
V^2 = u^2 + 2as
```
```
à as =^56 𝑣^6 - 56 𝑢^6 à ∆EK = m (^56 𝑣^6 - 56 𝑢^6 )
```
```
∆ EK =^56 m𝑣^6 - 56 m𝑢^6
```
```
∆EK = Final K.E – Initial K.E
```
```
Hence a body of mass, m moving with
velocity, v has K.E given by
```
```
EK =^56 𝑚𝑣^6
```
## Potential Energy, EP

```
Potential energy is the energy that the body
possesses by virtue of its state or position.
Examples
State – stretched string/spring – Strain

```
For a Hooke’s Law spring Ep =^56 𝑘𝑥^6

## Gravitational P.E


**Gravitational P.E** is the energy that the
body possesses by virtue of its position in a
gravitational field of another body.

Consider an object of mass, m moved
through a vertical distance, ∆ℎ near the
earth’s surface where the gravitational field
strength maybe assumed constant.

Change in Gravitational P.E, ∆𝐸c = Work
done, W

W = Fs à ∆𝐸c = F∆ℎ

The force required to lift the mass without
acceleration is equal to the gravitation
force, mg
